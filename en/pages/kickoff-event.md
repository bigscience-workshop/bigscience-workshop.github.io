# Kickoff event

On **April 28th**, a kickoff event will take place online to:
- **officially start** the workshop
- explain the **scope of the already created working groups** and where help is needed
- setup a deadline to have a **first version of the resources/tools** to work together (mostly a website gathering the information and a forum for discussions)
- **gather the participants** for a first (light) social event

The event will consist in:
- pre-recorded short videos for each working group
- a live Q&A forum throughout the year
- 2 live sessions (hosted through gather.town) so that everyone can attend at least one session in her/his day-time.
