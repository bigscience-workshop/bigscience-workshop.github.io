# Collaborative tasks

Note: The workshop involves a set of **collaborative tasks** conducted along the year and aimed at creating, sharing and evaluating a large multilingual dataset and a large language model as tools for research. The collaborative tasks are quite large since they involve several millions GPU hours on a supercomputer.

The goal of the collaborative tasks is in particular to collaboratively create and share several **artifacts** as tools for the research community:



*   A **Multilingual Dataset** for Research (possibly full-open-access, possibly behind an authentication access portal to follow GdPR and data privacy legislations => to be defined by the organization committee in charge of this artifact)
*   A **large Language Model** for Research (possibly full-open-access, possibly behind a researcherâ€™s authentication access portal like the dataset => to be defined by the organization committee in charge of this artifact)
*   **Software tools** created to complete the shared tasks, e.g. dataset filtering, model off-loading, etc (under very permissive licence, e.g. Apache2 => to be by the organization committee in charge of this artifact)
*   Extensive **documentation** of the evaluation results, protocols, approach, datasets, and tools developed in the course of the project for future reconduction

The organizational committees in charges of the collaborative task are in the process of being set up.

When they start to be more clearly defined, we'll add more information here, in the meantime the current draft document about the working groups on collaborative tasks can be found on the Google Drive [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZThn1Tz_LA0Z2ayCfVyym9sCyedzgrUMAl0c1wMSgHc/edit?usp=sharing).
