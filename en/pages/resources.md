# Ressources

This page list the ressources, tools and documents used for collaborating.

## General introduction to the tools

The tool stack is quite simple with at the moment 2 tools:
- a [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1db2hYZuRs2VjoIrVaVtZJ5FLE2iS7z3p?usp=sharing) hosting all the shared documents
- a [Discourse Forum](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/forum) hosting the discussions

These resources are viewable by everyone (even outside the organizers) and editable by the organizers.

To be able to edit/write/talk, there is a group associated to each tool of which the organizers are members:
- a [Google Group "Bigscience-Workshop"](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/bigscience-workshop) gives edit/write access to the Google Drive documents
- a [HuggingFace Organization "BigScience"](https://huggingface.co/bigscience) give edit/write access to the Forum
