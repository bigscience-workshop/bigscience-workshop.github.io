**BigScience** is a research workshop and is open to researchers, i.e. people affiliated with a research organization (in academia or industry) and whose day work is for instance at least in part to publish papers in peer-review venues, and to people whose technical and professional expertise bears relevance to the social aspects of the project. The BigScience organization is not a good place to learn about AI or find mentors as we do not have an internal mentoring program. We do intend to set up events and programs with mentoring aspects for the more general public and enthusiast community though so if you are a working on Machine Learning, AI and NLP as side projects or interested in learning about these fields you should subscribe to the mailing list to be informed about our upcoming public events (“follow the project”).
