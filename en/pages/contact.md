BigScience is a research workshop and is open to researchers, i.e. people affiliated with a research organization (in academia or industry) and whose day work is for instance (at least in part) to publish papers in peer-review venues, as well as to people whose technical and professional expertise bears relevance to the social aspects of the project.

The organization of the research workshop is not a good place to learn about AI or find mentors as we do not have an internal mentoring program. It's also not per-se a community for general AI or AGI discussions.

If you are interested in learning about AI/ML or already working on Machine Learning, AI and NLP side projects, note that we plan to do events for the AI/ML enthusiast community and the general public and you should fill the following Google Form to **stay informed about the project and future community/public events** by [entering your email here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3gYSfNX6aKFwDVKdp-42w2kAldasdFjMJnHCUTdlgo-5lqQ/viewform).
