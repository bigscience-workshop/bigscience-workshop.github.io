# Organization

## Participants

As detailed on the [Description page](page/description.md), BigScience takes as inspiration large international research collaboration like the LHC or the CERN. The workshop is thus designed and open to all the research community in NLP and AI interested in studying the **research questions surrounding large language models** (capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, ethics, environmental impact, general AI/cognitive research landscape) with a particular focus on the academic research communities.

The orgagnization of the workshop has thus been growing steadily from the [founding members](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pZxvdQZsRXCKyA3nvTSWhLyuQX5JLIzIE6aTYMmZXw/edit?usp=sharing) in the French NLP and AI community to a very largely international community of researchers.

The list of the founding members can be consulted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-pZxvdQZsRXCKyA3nvTSWhLyuQX5JLIzIE6aTYMmZXw/edit?usp=sharing) and the current list of members (in the process of being updated) can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-J6JSUBYVnyCp06vsZODTO-O8vQOFunX3nonfyof_J8/edit?usp=sharing).

The members are participating in Working Groups as detailed on the [Collaborative tasks page](pages/collaborative-tasks.md).

## Resources and tools

### General introduction to the tools

The tool stack is quite simple with at the moment with two main tools:
- a [Google Drive Folder](https://bit.ly/bigscience-drive) hosting all the shared documents
- a [Discourse Forum](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/forum) hosting the discussions

These tools are
- viewable/readable by everyone on the internet
- editable/writable only to the participants to the workshop

To be able to edit/write/talk, there is a group associated to each tool of which the organizers are members:
- a [Google Group "Bigscience-Workshop"](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/bigscience-workshop) gives edit/write access to the Google Drive documents
- a [HuggingFace Organization "BigScience"](https://huggingface.co/bigscience) give edit/write access to the Forum

### Main documents in the Google Drive
