# Big Science üå∏ Data Governance

## üê† Overview

The [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) "[Big Science](pages/index.md)" project is a year-long workshop that brings
together nearly 600 researchers from 50 countries to work together on better understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
-- a family of deep learning systems that are trained on considerable amounts of data to learn statistical properties of
language. LLMS have been increasingly adopted in contemporary language technologies, from Internet search to automatic
translation.

Our goal is to improve the scientific understanding of the capabilities and limitations of large-scale neural network
models in NLP. In doing so, we seek to create both a multilingual language corpus and an open-source large language
model, open to the scientific community. The May [MIT Tech Review article by Karen Hao](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/20/1025135/ai-large-language-models-bigscience-project/) provides an excellent overview of
the project in its broader context, and further details can be found in our 
recent article in VentureBeat: [NLP needs to
be open. 500+ researchers are trying to make it happen](https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/14/nlp-needs-to-be-open-500-researchers-are-trying-to-make-it-happen/).

A core part of this project focuses on creating ethical protocols for Data Governance, including the collection and
management of a training dataset. There are a wealth of language data sources to draw from to meet the growing needs of
these technologies, but bringing those together to train large models while giving due consideration to ethical concerns
such as **anonymization** (no PII), **consent** (if the dataset does include PII), and **contestation** (individuals can request
their information be removed from the dataset), remains an open problem.

To this end, we are exploring the feasibility of working with a small network of organizations who are themselves
interested in working on aspects of ethical data governance and can help develop tools and protocols for data
collection, hosting, and management. Together, these organizations serve as ‚ÄúData Custodians‚Äù for the Big Science
project.
