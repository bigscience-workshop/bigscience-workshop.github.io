- 10:45 - 11:30: Invited talk: "Experience of an open source project maintainer for scikit-learn", Olivier Grisel (ML software engineer at Inria Saclay & maintainer for the Scikit-learn project)

##### Abstract

This talk will reflect on my experience as an open source project maintainer. After quickly introducing the decade-long history of the scikit-learn project, its goals and organization, I will try to identify key ingredients necessary to keep a project such as scikit-learn valuable for a wide community of users and contributors. In particular we will focus on collaboration dynamics, interactions with users, automating cross-platform packaging automated quality insurance and interactions with the wider Open Source ecosystem.

##### Speaker bio

Olivier Grisel is a Machine Learning software engineer at Inria Saclay where we works as a maintainer for the Scikit-learn project [1] and occasional contributor to related projects. Olivier is also involved in teaching Deep Learning as part of MSc Data Sciences at IP Paris [2] and Machine Learning with Scikit-learn via a MOOC [3].
