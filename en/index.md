# The Summer of Language Models 21  (BigScience)

## üê† Overview
The "Summer of Language Models 21 üå∏" (in short "BigScience") is a **one-year long research workshop on very large language models** as used and studied in the field of Natural Language Processing and more generally Artifical Intelligence research.

The workshop is

- conducted from May 2021 to May 2022
- with several **live sessions/events** spread over the year ([first session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMBcm0TByF4) on April 28th, second session planned for end of July). Find all events [here](events.md).
- with **collaborative tasks** aimed at creating, sharing and evaluating a **very large multilingual dataset** and a **very large language model** as tools for research

This workshop will foster discussions and reflections around **the research questions surrounding large language models** (capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, ethics, environmental impact, role in the general AI/cognitive research landscape) as well as the challenges around creating and sharing such models and datasets for research purposes and among the research community.

The collaborative tasks involves creating, sharing and evaluating a large multilingual dataset and a large language model.
An uncommonly large compute budget was allocated for these collaborative tasks (several millions GPU hours on several thousands GPUs).

If successful, this workshop could be reconducted in the future involving an updated or different set of collaborative tasks.

###¬†üê£ What will be the outcomes?
- **Fostering discussion** on the research questions related to language models (capabilities, limitations, potential improvements, bias, ethics and social aspects, environmental impact, relation with cognitive neuroscience research) as well as more collaborative way to do large scale research in AI/NLP
- **Artifacts** created during the collaborative tasks (dataset, model, code tools)
- **Publications** in official proceedings (e.g. ACL, PMLR...) along the way

### üèò How is this organized?
Generally like a research workshop, i.e. with
- A **steering committee** (SC) giving scientific and general advice.
- An **organization committee** (OC) designing the collaborative tasks as well as organizing the workshop events and public participation. Given the diversity of tasks, the OC is split in **Working Groups** (WG).
Eventually the participation of **workshop attendants** (the public), in particular in guided aspects of the collaborative tasks and as live event attendance

### üó∫ How can I participate?
You can join as (see details of the roles in the main document BigScience - Organization):

- **Advisor** (Steering Committee member):

  * role: give general scientific/organization advice
  * time commitment: light - reading a newsletter every 2 weeks - giving feedback/advice

- **Participant** in a **Working Group** (Organizing Committee member)
  * role: joining one of the working groups of the OC (see list below): advising/designing/building the collaborative task (building the dataset/model/tools) or advising/designing/organizing the live events
  * time commitment: medium - depends on the chosen task (see details of the working groups below)

- **Chair/co-chair** of a **Working Group** (Organizing Committee member)
  * role: the chair(s) is supposed to provide at least the minimal amount of work necessary for having a very bare-bone version of the task. If other members are active in the WG, the chair(s) can mostly coordinate the effort and organise the decision process.
  * time commitment: more significant - also depends on the chosen WG

- As a **Workshop attendant** joining live events or some public aspect of the collaborative tasks (to be defined by the working groups)
  * role: participating in the collaborative task in a guided way following guidelines setup by the OC (helping build the dataset, helping build the tools)
  * time commitment: free - up to the attendant

## üì∞ News

### 21/07/2021 - BigScience Episode #1 üéâ

It's been 2 months since we kicked off the BigScience project, time to present some first results. Join us for talks and posters sessions on July 30th, 2021. The event is co-located with the second ELLIS NLP workshop. You can find more information and the program [here](events.md).

### 19/04/2021 - preparing a kick-off event

The working group of the OC is now planning a kick off event on April 28th to introduce the workshop.

### 13/04/2021 - on to the moon üöÄ

The GPU allocation committee of the French Jean Zay supercomputer had heated discussions last week during the decision meetings, coming in part from the size and ambition of the project. The overall reviews were overwhelmingly positive, in particular on the scientific and collaborative aspects.

The project has been allocated 2,5 millions GPU hours üéâ

The first half of the requested GPU budget for the first half of the one-year timeline. The evolution of the project will be re-evaluated in 6 months and we‚Äôll fill the standard extension request procedure for the second slice of the compute budget.

This is very good news and the project is now on firm basis and can officially start.

It‚Äôs a good opportunity to note how a strong national/regional research community like the French/European NLP community, and a government supportive of new endeavours and technologies like the French government can make such an ambitious collaborative project a reality. My feeling is that similar projects can and will see the light in many countries/regions and maybe even globally and, as a Frenchman I‚Äôm obviously super happy that France is a strong supporter of this open-science concept and can be the birthplace for this project üêì
